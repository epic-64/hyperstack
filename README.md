hyperstack is a todo-list application for my personal use.

## State
Early development, not ready for use.

## Characteristics
- Opinionated todo management with recurring tasks, blueprints and analytics
- Fully web-based, no installation required, runs in any modern browser
- Data stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB
- Responsive design, works on both desktop and mobile devices
- No login, no account, no tracking, no ads, no "calling home"

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript, Dexie.js, CSS
- no frameworks, no nonsense

## Run in dev mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
